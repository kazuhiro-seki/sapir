# S-APIR: turning news texts into business sentiment

## Preface

This is a repository of the demonstration system of my ongoing work, partly carried out as an [APIR](https://www.apir.or.jp) research project, to turn news articles into business sentiment. The system also allows a user to analyze any given factors that may/may not influence business sentiment. More features are planned to be added. Stay tuned!
